     This web application that takes a user's birthday<br>
    and calculates the day of the week they were<br>
    born and then depending on their gender<br>
    outputs their Akan Name. <br><br>

    Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. <br>
    Frequently in Ghana, children are given their<br>
     first name as a 'day name' which corresponds<br>
      to the day in the week they were born.<br>
       Here are Ghanian day names.<br>
